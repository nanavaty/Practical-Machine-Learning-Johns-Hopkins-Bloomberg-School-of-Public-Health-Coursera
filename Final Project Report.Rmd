Reproducibility
In order to reproduce the same results, you need a certain set of packages as well as setting a pseudo random seed equal to the one I have used.
Note: To install, for instance, the rattle package in R, run this command: install.packages("rattle").
The following Libraries were used for this project, which you should install and load them in your working environment.

library(rattle)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)
Finally, load the same seed with the following line of code:

set.seed(56789)
Getting Data
First of all, set your current working directory.

setwd("~/GitHub/Practical-Machine-Learning-Johns-Hopkins-Bloomberg-School-of-Public-Health-Coursera/Project")
The following code fragment downloads the dataset to the data folder in the current working directory.

trainUrl <-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainFile <- "./data/pml-training.csv"
testFile  <- "./data/pml-testing.csv"
if (!file.exists("./data")) {
  dir.create("./data")
}
if (!file.exists(trainFile)) {
  download.file(trainUrl, destfile = trainFile, method = "curl")
}
if (!file.exists(testFile)) {
  download.file(testUrl, destfile = testFile, method = "curl")
}
rm(trainUrl)
rm(testUrl)
Reading Data
After downloading the data from the data source, we can read the two csv files into two data frames.

trainRaw <- read.csv(trainFile)
testRaw <- read.csv(testFile)
dim(trainRaw)
dim(testRaw)
rm(trainFile)
rm(testFile)
The training data set contains r dim(trainRaw)[1] observations and r dim(trainRaw)[2] variables, while the testing data set contains r dim(testRaw)[1] observations and r dim(testRaw)[2] variables. The classe variable in the training set is the outcome to predict.

Cleaning Data
In this step, we will clean the dataset and get rid of observations with missing values as well as some meaningless variables.

We clean the Near Zero Variance Variables.
NZV <- nearZeroVar(trainRaw, saveMetrics = TRUE)
head(NZV, 20)
training01 <- trainRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
testing01 <- testRaw[, !NZV$nzv]
dim(training01)
dim(testing01)
rm(trainRaw)
rm(testRaw)
rm(NZV)
Removing some columns of the dataset that do not contribute much to the accelerometer measurements.
regex <- grepl("^X|timestamp|user_name", names(training01))
training <- training01[, !regex]
testing <- testing01[, !regex]
rm(regex)
rm(training01)
rm(testing01)
dim(training)
dim(testing)
Removing columns that contain NA's.
cond <- (colSums(is.na(training)) == 0)
training <- training[, cond]
testing <- testing[, cond]
rm(cond)
Now, the cleaned training data set contains r dim(training)[1] observations and r dim(training)[2] variables, while the testing data set contains r dim(testing)[1] observations and r dim(testing)[2] variables.

Correlation Matrix of Columns in the Training Data set.

corrplot(cor(training[, -length(names(training))]), method = "color", tl.cex = 0.5)
Partitioning Training Set
we split the cleaned training set into a pure training data set (70%) and a validation data set (30%). We will use the validation data set to conduct cross validation in future steps.

set.seed(56789) # For reproducibile purpose
inTrain <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 0.70, list = FALSE)
validation <- training[-inTrain, ]
training <- training[inTrain, ]
rm(inTrain)
The Dataset now consists of r dim(training)[2] variables with the observations divided as following:

Training Data: r dim(training)[1] observations.
Validation Data: r dim(validation)[1] observations.
Testing Data: r dim(testing)[1] observations.
Data Modelling
Decision Tree
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using Decision Tree algorithm.

modelTree <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "class")
prp(modelTree)
Now, we estimate the performance of the model on the validation data set.

predictTree <- predict(modelTree, validation, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictTree)
accuracy <- postResample(predictTree, validation$classe)
ose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictTree)$overall[1])
rm(predictTree)
rm(modelTree)
The Estimated Accuracy of the Random Forest Model is r accuracy[1]*100% and the Estimated Out-of-Sample Error is r ose*100%.

Random Forest
We fit a predictive model for activity recognition using Random Forest algorithm because it automatically selects important variables and is robust to correlated covariates & outliers in general.
We will use 5-fold cross validation when applying the algorithm.

modelRF <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "rf", trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 5), ntree = 250)
modelRF
Now, we estimate the performance of the model on the validation data set.

predictRF <- predict(modelRF, validation)
confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictRF)
accuracy <- postResample(predictRF, validation$classe)
ose <- 1 - as.numeric(confusionMatrix(validation$classe, predictRF)$overall[1])
rm(predictRF)
The Estimated Accuracy of the Random Forest Model is r accuracy[1]*100% and the Estimated Out-of-Sample Error is r ose*100%.
Random Forests yielded better Results, as expected!

Predicting The Manner of Exercise for Test Data Set
Now, we apply the Random Forest model to the original testing data set downloaded from the data source. We remove the problem_id column first.

rm(accuracy)
rm(ose)
predict(modelRF, testing[, -length(names(testing))])
Generating Files to submit as answers for the Assignment
Function to generate files with predictions to submit for assignment.

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("./Assignment_Solutions/problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i], file = filename, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(predict(modelRF, testing[, -length(names(testing))]))
rm(modelRF)
rm(training)
rm(testing)
rm(validation)
rm(pml_write_files)
